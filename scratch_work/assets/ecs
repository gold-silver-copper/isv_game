What I'm noticing is that you have a bunch of components saying "this is a". "This is a wall", "This is a player", "This is a tile", "This is a AI". This is a common mistake with ECS, where you're going right back to defining objects, instead of defining behaviours (systems), and facilitating them with the data (components) they need.
For example, you state you can't remember where you use "Wall", which makes sense, because I would say that's just an Entity with the "Tile" and "Blocking" components. Maybe add a "Health" component if it's a destructable wall.
Most of these you can fix just by renaming them.

As others have said, some of these components can also be merged. Does it ever make sense for an entity to have a Health component, but not a BaseHealth component, or vice versa? Merge them. The beauty of ECS is that it's extremely easy to refactor components. Merging or separating components can usually be done with a find and replace.

With that, here's my suggested component list:

    Position

    Sprite (Replaces Tile)

    Blocking

    Opaque

    Name

    ViewShed (Combines with KnownShed)

    Action

    Health (Combines with BaseHealth and Dead)

    Stamina (Combines with BaseStamina)

    Controllable (Takes in commands to control the entity)

    UserInputControls (Uses Controllable. replaces Player)

    AIControls (Uses Controllable, replaces AI)
